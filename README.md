Example of MTU6050 usage.

Multiple branch for absolute position of sensor
Every branch has a pic of the sensor and his position according to surface

Basically need to change according to absolute position of sensor related to surface  

'''
  acceleration[0] = AccX / norm_g;
  acceleration[1] = AccY/norm_g;
  acceleration[2] = AccZ/norm_g;
